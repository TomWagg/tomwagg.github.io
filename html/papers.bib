                   double compact objects (DCOs) in our Milky Way. We present new
                   simulations of the populations of double black holes (BHBHs),
                   black hole neutron stars (BHNSs) and double neutron stars
                   (NSNSs) that will be detectable by the planned space-based
                   gravitational wave detector LISA. For our estimates, we use an
                   empirically-informed model of the metallicity dependent star
                   formation history of the Milky Way. We populate it using an
                   extensive suite of binary population-synthesis predictions for
                   varying assumptions relating to mass transfer, common-envelope,
                   supernova kicks, remnant masses and wind mass loss physics. For
                   a 4(10)-year LISA mission, we predict between 30-370(50-550)
                   detections over these variations, out of which 6-154(9-238) are
                   BHBHs, 2-198(3-289) are BHNSs and 3-35(4-57) are NSNSs. We
                   discuss how the variations in the physics assumptions alter the
                   distribution of properties of the detectable systems, even when
                   the detection rates are unchanged. In particular we discuss the
                   observable characteristics such as the chirp mass, eccentricity
                   and sky localisation and how the BHBH, BHNS and NSNS populations
                   can be distinguished, both from each other and from the more
                   numerous double white dwarf population. We further discuss the
                   possibility of multi-messenger observations of pulsar
                   populations with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and assess the
                   benefits of extending the LISA mission.}},

                   wave detections of black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) mergers
                   requires comparing observations with population synthesis
                   predictions. In this work we investigate the combined impact
                   from the key uncertainties in population synthesis modelling of
                   the isolated binary evolution channel: the physical processes in
                   massive binary-star evolution and the star formation history as
                   a function of metallicity, $Z$, and redshift $z,
                   \mathcal{S}(Z,z)$. Considering these uncertainties we create 560
                   different publicly available model realizations and calculate
                   the rate and distribution characteristics of detectable BHBH,
                   BHNS, and NSNS mergers. We find that our stellar evolution and
                   $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ variations can impact the predicted intrinsic
                   and detectable merger rates by factors $10^2$-$10^4$. We find
                   that BHBH rates are dominantly impacted by $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$
                   variations, NSNS rates by stellar evolution variations and BHNS
                   rates by both. We then consider the combined impact from all
                   uncertainties considered in this work on the detectable mass
                   distribution shapes (chirp mass, individual masses and mass
                   ratio). We find that the BHNS mass distributions are
                   predominantly impacted by massive binary-star evolution changes.
                   For BHBH and NSNS we find that both uncertainties are important.
                   We also find that the shape of the delay time and birth
                   metallicity distributions are typically dominated by the choice
                   of $\mathcal{S}(Z,z)$ for BHBH, BHNS and NSNS. We identify
                   several examples of robust features in the mass distributions
                   predicted by all 560 models, such that we expect more than 95\%
                   of BHBH detections to contain a BH $rsim 8\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and
                   have mass ratios $\lesssim 4$. Our work demonstrates that it is
                   essential to consider a wide range of allowed models to study
                   double compact object merger rates and properties.}},

                   evolution of the binary black hole (BBH) merger rate,
                   $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$. We make predictions for
                   $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$ as a function of black hole mass for
                   systems originating from isolated binaries. To this end, we
                   investigate correlations between the delay time and black hole
                   mass by means of the suite of binary population synthesis
                   simulations, COMPAS. We distinguish two channels: the common
                   envelope (CE), and the stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF)
                   channel, characterised by whether the system has experienced a
                   common envelope or not. We find that the CE channel
                   preferentially produces BHs with masses below about
                   $30\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and short delay times ($t_{\rm delay}
                   \lesssim 1$Gyr), while the stable RLOF channel primarily forms
                   systems with BH masses above $30\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and long delay
                   times ($t_{\rm delay} rsim 1$Gyr). We provide a new fit for the
                   metallicity specific star-formation rate density based on the
                   Illustris TNG simulations, and use this to convert the delay
                   time distributions into a prediction of $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$.
                   This leads to a distinct redshift evolution of
                   $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$ for high and low primary BH masses. We
                   furthermore find that, at high redshift, $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$
                   is dominated by the CE channel, while at low redshift it
                   contains a large contribution ($\sim 40\%$) from the stable RLOF
                   channel. Our results predict that, for increasing redshifts,
                   BBHs with component masses above $30\rm{M}_{\odot}$ will become
                   increasingly scarce relative to less massive BBH systems.
                   Evidence of this distinct evolution of $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$ for
                   different BH masses can be tested with future detectors.}},

                   period of 11.6 d around a metal-rich G6 star. Its mass and
                   radius (1.23 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.04 M$_{Jup}$ and 0.89
                   {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 R$_{Jup}$) support the trend that warm
                   Jupiters have smaller radii than hot Jupiters. WASP-131b is a
                   bloated Saturn-mass planet (0.27 M$_{Jup}$ and 1.22 R$_{Jup}$).
                   Its large scaleheight and bright (V = 10.1) host star make it a
                   good target for atmospheric characterization. WASP-132b (0.41
                   M$_{Jup}$ and 0.87 R$_{Jup}$) is among the least irradiated and
                   coolest of WASP planets, having a 7.1-d orbit around a K4 star.
                   WASP-139b is a 'super-Neptune' akin to HATS-7b and HATS-8b,
                   being the lowest mass planet yet found by WASP (0.12 M$_{Jup}$
                   and 0.80 R$_{Jup}$). The metal-rich K0 host star appears to be
                   anomalously dense, akin to HAT-P-11. WASP-140b is a
                   2.4-M$_{Jup}$ planet in an eccentric (e = 0.047
                   {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.004) 2.2-d orbit. The planet's radius is
                   large (1.4 R$_{Jup}$), but uncertain owing to the grazing
                   transit (b = 0.93). The 10.4-d rotation period of the K0 host
                   star suggests a young age, and the time-scale for tidal
                   circularization is likely to be the lowest of all known
                   eccentric hot Jupiters. WASP-141b (2.7 M$_{Jup}$, 1.2 R$_{Jup}$

                   P = 2.1 d) are typical hot Jupiters orbiting metal-rich F stars.
                   We show that the period distribution within the hot-Jupiter
                   bulge does not depend on the metallicity of the host star.}},

  abstract      = {{We have used photometry from the WASP-South instrument to identify 5
                   stars showing planet-like transits in their light curves. The
                   planetary nature of the companions to these stars has been
                   confirmed using photometry from the EulerCam instrument on the
                   Swiss Euler 1.2-m telescope and the TRAPPIST telescope, and
                   spectroscopy obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph. The planets
                   discovered are hot Jupiter systems with orbital periods in the
                   range 2.17 to 5.75 days, masses from 0.3 M$_{Jup}$ to 1.2
                   M$_{Jup}$ and with radii from 1 R$_{Jup}$ to 1.5 R$_{Jup}$.
                   These planets orbit bright stars (V = 11-13) with spectral types
                   in the range F9 to G4. WASP-126 is the brightest planetary
                   system in this sample and hosts a low-mass planet with a large
                   radius (0.3 M$_{Jup}$,0.95 R$_{Jup}$), making it a good target
                   for transmission spectroscopy. The high density of WASP-129 A
                   suggests that it is a helium-rich star similar to HAT-P-11 A.
                   WASP-133 A has an enhanced surface lithium abundance compared to
                   other old G-type stars, particularly other planet host stars.
                   These planetary systems are good targets for follow-up
                   observations with ground-based and space-based facilities to
                   study their atmospheric and dynamical properties.
