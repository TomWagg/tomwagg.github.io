     abstract = "{We present LEGWORK (LISA Evolution and Gravitational Wave Orbit Kit), an
        open-source Python package for making predictions about stellar-
        origin gravitational wave sources and their detectability in
        LISA or other space-based gravitational wave detectors. LEGWORK
        can be used to evolve the orbits of sources due to gravitational
        wave emission, calculate gravitational wave strains (using post-
        Newtonian approximations), compute signal-to-noise ratios and
        visualise the results. It can be applied to a variety of
        potential sources, including binaries consisting of white
        dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. Although we focus on
        double compact objects, in principle LEGWORK can be used for any
        system with a user-specified orbital evolution, such as those
        affected by a third object or gas drag. We optimised the package
        to make it efficient for use in population studies which can
        contain tens-of-millions of sources. This paper describes the
        package and presents several potential use cases. We explain in
        detail the derivations of the expressions behind the package as
        well as identify and clarify some discrepancies currently
        present in the literature. We hope that LEGWORK will enable and
        accelerate future studies triggered by the rapidly growing
        interest in gravitational wave sources.}",

     abstract = "{Gravitational wave detectors are starting to reveal the redshift
        evolution of the binary black hole (BBH) merger rate,
        $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$. We make predictions for
        $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$ as a function of black hole mass for
        systems originating from isolated binaries. To this end, we
        investigate correlations between the delay time and black hole
        mass by means of the suite of binary population synthesis
        simulations, COMPAS. We distinguish two channels: the common
        envelope (CE), and the stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF)
        channel, characterised by whether the system has experienced a
        common envelope or not. We find that the CE channel
        preferentially produces BHs with masses below about
        $30\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and short delay times ($t_{\rm delay}
        \lesssim 1$Gyr), while the stable RLOF channel primarily forms
        systems with BH masses above $30\rm{M}_{\odot}$ and long delay
        times ($t_{\rm delay} rsim 1$Gyr). We provide a new fit for the
        metallicity specific star-formation rate density based on the
        Illustris TNG simulations, and use this to convert the delay
        time distributions into a prediction of $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$.
        This leads to a distinct redshift evolution of
        $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$ for high and low primary BH masses. We
        furthermore find that, at high redshift, $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$
        is dominated by the CE channel, while at low redshift it
        contains a large contribution ($\sim 40\%$) from the stable RLOF
        channel. Our results predict that, for increasing redshifts,
        BBHs with component masses above $30\rm{M}_{\odot}$ will become
        increasingly scarce relative to less massive BBH systems.
        Evidence of this distinct evolution of $R_{\mathrm{BBH}}(z)$ for
        different BH masses can be tested with future detectors.}",

        10.1-12.4. WASP-130b is a 'warm Jupiter' having an orbital
        period of 11.6 d around a metal-rich G6 star. Its mass and
        radius (1.23 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.04 M$_{Jup}$ and 0.89
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03 R$_{Jup}$) support the trend that warm
        Jupiters have smaller radii than hot Jupiters. WASP-131b is a
        bloated Saturn-mass planet (0.27 M$_{Jup}$ and 1.22 R$_{Jup}$).
        Its large scaleheight and bright (V = 10.1) host star make it a
        good target for atmospheric characterization. WASP-132b (0.41
        M$_{Jup}$ and 0.87 R$_{Jup}$) is among the least irradiated and
        coolest of WASP planets, having a 7.1-d orbit around a K4 star.
        WASP-139b is a 'super-Neptune' akin to HATS-7b and HATS-8b,
        being the lowest mass planet yet found by WASP (0.12 M$_{Jup}$
        and 0.80 R$_{Jup}$). The metal-rich K0 host star appears to be
        anomalously dense, akin to HAT-P-11. WASP-140b is a
        2.4-M$_{Jup}$ planet in an eccentric (e = 0.047
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.004) 2.2-d orbit. The planet's radius is
        large (1.4 R$_{Jup}$), but uncertain owing to the grazing
        transit (b = 0.93). The 10.4-d rotation period of the K0 host
        star suggests a young age, and the time-scale for tidal
        circularization is likely to be the lowest of all known
        eccentric hot Jupiters. WASP-141b (2.7 M$_{Jup}$, 1.2 R$_{Jup}$
        and P = 3.3 d) and WASP-142b (0.84 M$_{Jup}$, 1.53 R$_{Jup}$ and
        P = 2.1 d) are typical hot Jupiters orbiting metal-rich F stars.
        We show that the period distribution within the hot-Jupiter
        bulge does not depend on the metallicity of the host star.}",

        These planets orbit bright stars (V = 11-13) with spectral types
        in the range F9 to G4. WASP-126 is the brightest planetary
        system in this sample and hosts a low-mass planet with a large
        radius (0.3 M$_{Jup}$,0.95 R$_{Jup}$), making it a good target
        for transmission spectroscopy. The high density of WASP-129 A

        WASP-133 A has an enhanced surface lithium abundance compared to
        other old G-type stars, particularly other planet host stars.
        These planetary systems are good targets for follow-up
