     abstract = "{The recently reported observation of VFTS 243 is the first example of a
        massive black-hole binary system with negligible binary
        interaction following black-hole formation. The black-hole mass
        ($\approx 10\ M_{\odot}$) and near-circular orbit ($e\approx
        0.02$) of VFTS 243 suggest that the progenitor star experienced
        complete collapse, with energy-momentum being lost predominantly
        through neutrinos. VFTS 243 enables us to constrain the natal
        kick and neutrino-emission asymmetry during black-hole
        formation. At 68\% C.L., the natal kick velocity (mass
        decrement) is $\lesssim 10$ km/s ($\lesssim 1.0\ M_{\odot}$).
        Most likely $\approx 0.3\ M_{\odot}$ were ejected, presumably in
        neutrinos, and the black hole experienced a natal kick of $4$
        km/s. The neutrino-emission asymmetry is $\lesssim 4$\%, with
        best fit values of $\sim$0-0.2\%. Such a small neutrino natal
        kick accompanying black-hole formation is in agreement with
        theoretical predictions.}",

        wave detections of black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) mergers
        requires comparing observations with population synthesis
        predictions. In this work, we investigate the combined impact
        from the key uncertainties in population synthesis modelling of
        the isolated binary evolution channel: the physical processes in
        massive binary-star evolution and the star formation history as
        a function of metallicity, Z, and redshift z, $\mathcal
        {S}(Z,z)$. Considering these uncertainties, we create 560
        different publicly available model realizations and calculate
        the rate and distribution characteristics of detectable BHBH,
        BHNS, and NSNS mergers. We find that our stellar evolution and
        $\mathcal {S}(Z,z)$ variations can combined impact the predicted
        intrinsic and detectable merger rates by factors in the range
        {}10$^{2}$-{}10$^{4}$. We find that BHBH rates are dominantly
        impacted by $\mathcal {S}(Z,z)$ variations, NSNS rates by
        stellar evolution variations and BHNS rates by both. We then
        consider the combined impact from all uncertainties considered
        in this work on the detectable mass distribution shapes (chirp
        mass, individual masses, and mass ratio). We find that the BHNS
        mass distributions are predominantly impacted by massive binary-
        star evolution changes. For BHBH and NSNS, we find that both
        uncertainties are important. We also find that the shape of the
        delay time and birth metallicity distributions are typically
        dominated by the choice of $\mathcal {S}(Z,z)$ for BHBH, BHNS,
        and NSNS. We identify several examples of robust features in the
        mass distributions predicted by all 560 models, such that we
        expect more than 95 per cent of BHBH detections to contain a BH
        $rsim 8\, \rm {M}_{\odot }$ and have mass ratios
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 4. Our work demonstrates that it is
        essential to consider a wide range of allowed models to study
        double compact object merger rates and properties. Conversely,
        larger observed samples could allow us to decipher currently
        unconstrained stages of stellar and binary evolution.}",

        channels: the common envelope (CE), and the stable Roche-lobe
        overflow (RLOF) channel, characterized by whether the system has
        experienced a common envelope or not. We find that the CE
        channel preferentially produces BHs with masses below about 30 M
        $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ and short delay times (t $_{delay}$
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 1 Gyr), while the stable RLOF channel
        primarily forms systems with BH masses above 30 M

        This leads to a distinct redshift evolution of R $_{BBH}$(z) for
        high and low primary BH masses. We furthermore find that, at

        channel. Our results predict that, for increasing redshifts,
        BBHs with component masses above 30 M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$
        will become increasingly scarce relative to less massive BBH
        systems. Evidence of this distinct evolution of R $_{BBH}$(z)

        range 2.17 to 5.75 days, masses from 0.3 M$_{Jup}$ to 1.2
        M$_{Jup}$ and with radii from 1 R$_{Jup}$ to 1.5 R$_{Jup}$.
        These planets orbit bright stars (V = 11-13) with spectral types
        in the range F9 to G4. WASP-126 is the brightest planetary
        system in this sample and hosts a low-mass planet with a large
        radius (0.3 M$_{Jup}$,0.95 R$_{Jup}$), making it a good target
        for transmission spectroscopy. The high density of WASP-129 A
        suggests that it is a helium-rich star similar to HAT-P-11 A.
        WASP-133 A has an enhanced surface lithium abundance compared to
        other old G-type stars, particularly other planet host stars.
        These planetary systems are good targets for follow-up
        observations with ground-based and space-based facilities to
        study their atmospheric and dynamical properties.
