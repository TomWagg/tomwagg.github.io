                    <h2 id="intro">Setting the Scene</h2>
                    <p>
                        Let's take a step back for a moment and cover some basic background information. First, let's talk about the stars of this production: <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> ðŸª¨.
                        Near-Earth objects are defined as asteroids and comets that have a perihelion distance (its closest distance to the Sun) less than 1.3 times the distance from the Earth to the
                        Sun. These objects are important for a variety of reasons from astrobiology to rare material mining, but perhaps most important is the potential threat they pose to Earth. To
                        put it simply, we do not want the end up like the dinosaurs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For these reasons it is essential that we catalogue all <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> and calculate their orbits in order to identify any that could be dangerous for Earth.
                        <span class="jargon">NEO</span> follow-up is important for this task, since follow-up observations are often the best way to full constrain and orbit and confirm a potential
                        detection from something like LSST. Currently, every night a list of potential <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> are posted to the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span>, the
                        Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page for the follow-up network to observe. This list displays around two dozen objects per night at the moment...but that's all going to change
                        when <strike>the fire nation attacks</strike> LSST comes online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (<span class="jargon">LSST</span>) is going to rapidly identify solar system objects from its first night of observations.
                        Due to its ability to see fainter objects that current surveys, this will shed a new light on previously elusive solar system objects. Before this project we suspected this
                        could have dire implications for <span class="jargon">NEO</span> follow-up but now we have quantified this issue.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="sims">Simulating NEO follow-up during LSST</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hopefully you're now convinced it is a good idea to keep track of all of these objects! Our job at this point was to simulate how LSST will affect
                        <span class="jargon">NEO</span> follow-up and for that we essentially need three things:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" />
                            A simulated population of solar system objects
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" />
                            A predicted schedule of where LSST will observe on each night for its 10 years
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" />
                            A method for scoring each potential object to decided whether it warrants follow-up
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The first step is relatively simple since catalogues of these objects already exist, in particular we use the Simulated Solar System Catalogue. We did additionally improve on
                        this catalogue by accounting for prior known objects and created a hybrid catalogue, but I'll talk about that in a separate post.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the predicted schedule and observations we know the baseline survey strategy plan for LSST, which outlines which areas of the sky it will observe and for how long. We used
                        a simulator that follows this strategy but also includes predictions for the fraction of downtime and bad weather that could affect things as well. All in all these simulated
                        observations of the solar system span over 10 years and 50 million observations!

                        Finally, to talk about scoring potential <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> we first need to briefly talk about observations and tracklets. Observations of solar system objects
                        are general formed out of a series of "tracklets", which consist of at least 2 observations within a short period of time. The motion over these short periods of time is
                        generally linear and it is easier to associate the two observations with one another. You can then connect these tracklets over time and fit an orbit to their motion (this is
                        referred to as "linking"). Check out the digram to see an example of this where we get 3 successive nights of observations.

                        In reality, there are uncertainties on observations and so multiple orbits can fit the same tracklet. The scoring of these tracklets are potential
                        <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> is simply done as a fraction of the orbits that correspond to an <span class="jargon">NEO</span> orbit (which remember from above just means a
                        closest approach to the sun of 1.3 au). This calculation is done using a code called <code>digest2</code>.

                        Okay so now putting that all together, we have a series of mock observations of simulated solar system objects, each of which is assigned an
                        <span class="jargon">NEO</span> score from 0 to 100. The current threshold for submission to the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span> is a score of 65 and so, using thism we
                        calculated, the number of objects that would be submitted to the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span> in the first year of LSST using current criteria.

                    <p>
                        There's a lot of information in this plot so let's walk through it in detail. The top panel shows the traffic of the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span>, which means the total
                        number of objects that will be submitted to the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span> according to current criteria. The bottom panel shows the purity, which means the fraction of
                        the submitted objects that are <i>actually</i> <span class="jargon">NEOs</span>. Each of these quantities are plotted over the first year of LSST and for a variety of required
                        number of observations. For example, this means that the $N_{\rm obs} = 3$ line means we only include that tracklets that have at least 3 observations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the top panel we see that the traffic could increase to as much as 50,000 objects in a single night and the purity could go as low as 0.5%. Remember that the current
                        numbers are around two dozen objects with a purity of around 25%. The impact of LSST is HUGE, even when requiring a large number of observations of each tracklet ðŸ˜¨
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In case you're wondering about the general trends: the long period increase and decrease is seasonal and is due to the <span class="jargon">ecliptic</span> plane (where
                        <span class="jargon">MBAs</span> reside) moving low and being observed more at certain times of year. The shorter term changes are due to the moon, you'll note there are dips
                        in purity around every 30 days!
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="best_case">What about the best case scenario?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Well, that's not good for <span class="jargon">NEO</span> follow-up! ðŸ˜± Let's imagine the best case scenario in which we can fully predict the future, would things be better?
                        LSST can confirm many <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> without any help from the follow-up community, so if we knew beforehand which objects would get re-observed enough by
                        LSST then we could skip sending them to the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this scenario, the traffic can still get as high as 200 objects on a single night but for the majority of the year it should still be in the current range that the
                        <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span> expects. The average purity is around 25% which is approximately what you find on the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span> currently. So this is
                        great news!
                    </p>
                    <p>Now the simple question is: <b>how can we achieve or approximate this best case scenario without consulting an oracle?</b> Time to think about some mitigation strategies!</p>

                    <h2 id="mitigation">Predicting the future to mitigate LSST's impact on <span class="jargon">NEO</span> follow-up</h2>
                    <p>
                        We've just said that if we could predict whether LSST will perform self-follow-up on objects then we'd be able to mitigate LSST's impact. This drove us to create an algorithm
                        that attempts to do exactly that!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For an object to be constrained by LSST it requires at least 2 observations per night, on 3 nights, in a 15 night window. (So we our miraculous foresight only needs to reach
                        about two weeks into the future ðŸ˜‰). Given these requirements, we need to answer two questions
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">

                            Where will LSST point over the next two weeks?

                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" />
                            What is the location and brightness of the object during each exposure?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For predicting LSST's future pointings we use the <code>rubin_sim</code> python package to get an optimistic future schedule (optimistic because it doesn't account for
                        unscheduled downtime due to things like bad weather). In reality one may able to adapt this algorithm to account for the fact that we'll have some short term weather forecast
                        and increase its accuracy but we decided to make a conservative estimate.

                    <p>
                        Predicting the location and brightness of the object over time requires a well constrained orbit. The problem is that, from our observations, we only constrain the on-sky
                        position and motion, but we don't know the distance to the object or the speed at which it is moving towards or away from us. Therefore, there are many possible orbits that
                        could fit a given observation. Check out the plot to the right that I made to illustrate this point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can see that given a single set of observations from Earth (in the direction of the arrow), you can get a very different orbit. To account for this we create a grid of
                        potential orbits based on the distance and speed it is moving towards or away from us (restricted to ranges that are reasonable for an <span class="jargon">NEO</span>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For each of those orbits we compute its position and brightness over the course of the next two weeks using <code>OpenOrb</code>. From this point it is a simple matter of
                        checking for each orbit whether it is observed at least twice on 3 nights in this window. We assign the probability of self-follow-up as a simple fraction of these orbits that
                        achieve self-follow-up.

                    <h3 id="future_results">How effective are we at predicting the future?</h3>
                    <p>
                        So how did we do? We find that we are able to accurately predict whether an object requires external follow-up 74% of the time on average! In other words, we are able to
                        predict the future for around 3 of every 4 objects. This has important implications for what LSST will send to the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using a threshold of $p = 0.7$ for submitting an object to the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span>, we find that our algorithm reduces the average nightly traffic of the
                        <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span> back to around 200 objects per night, very close to the best case scenario! However, only around 5% of these objects turn out to be actual
                        <span class="jargon">NEOs</span>. Let's talk more about why this is the case and what we can do about it in the last section.

                        We've shown how our new algorithm could really improve the situation but there is still the problem of purity of submissions. The main cause for the lack purity is the large
                        background of <span class="jargon">MBAs</span>. This isn't a problem currently as all of the brighter <span class="jargon">MBAs</span> have been identified, however LSST will
                        probe to much fainter depths and so there is an immense volume of undiscovered <span class="jargon">MBAs</span> that will be observed. Hope is not lost though! There are a
                        couple of different approaches for reducing the effect of this background that we can consider.

                        None of these factors will necessarily separate <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> from <span class="jargon">MBAs</span> alone, but one can imagine combining them together into
                        an overall score. For example, if you found an object at a high <span class="jargon">ecliptic latitude</span>, moving further from the <span class="jargon">ecliptic</span> and
                        it was faint and rapidly tumbling, you'd probably think it much more likely that it was an <span class="jargon">NEO</span>!

                    <p>
                        As we talked about above, the main issue is that LSST will discover a plethora of previously unknown faint <span class="jargon">MBAs</span> and these are the unfortunate
                        background against which we are searching for <span class="jargon">NEOs</span>. It is expected that after the first year of LSST that 85% of
                        <span class="jargon">MBAs</span> will be identified. One could therefore imagine that waiting until this first year was complete would make follow-up much easier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We tested whether delaying would have any effect and you can see the results in the plot to the right. The top panel shows how the traffic from previously unknown sources
                        changes over the course of the 10 years (we only compute it for the first 50 nights in each year that have observations). Note the log scale,
                        <span class="jargon">MBAs</span> decrease drastically over the first few years before aligning with the constant steady rate from <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> which doesn't
                        change significantly over the entire survey.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The implications of this can be seen in the second panel, where we see the average nightly purity strongly increase as the survey progress and the remaining
                        <span class="jargon">MBAs</span> are identified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We therefore recommend that general <span class="jargon">NEO</span> follow-up from LSST not be attempted for at least the first year of LSST. However, this doesn't mean that we
                        need to ignore <i>every</i> object that is identified as a potential <span class="jargon">NEO</span> by LSST. Instead we can just place a conservative cut on the observed
                        objects to ensure that we maintain a reasonable traffic and purity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We explore that in one last plot to see how varying the minimum <span class="jargon">ecliptic latitude</span> can affect the average nightly traffic and purity. If you're
                        interested then go ahead and try out an interactive version of this plot using the button below.
