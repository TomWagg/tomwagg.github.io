                    <h2 id="intro">Setting the Scene</h2>
                    <p>
                        Let's take a step back for a moment and cover some basic background information. First, let's talk about the stars of this production: <span class="jargon">NEOs</span>.
                        Near-Earth objects are defined as asteroids and comets that have a perihelion distance (its closest distance to the Sun) less than 1.3 times the distance from the Earth to the
                        Sun. These objects are important for a variety of reasons from astrobiology to rare material mining, but perhaps most important is the potential threat they pose to Earth. To
                        put it simply, we do not want the end up like the dinosaurs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For these reasons it is essential that we catalogue all <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> and calculate their orbits in order to identify any that could be dangerous for Earth.
                        <span class="jargon">NEO</span> follow-up is important for this task, since follow-up observations are often the best way to full constrain and orbit and confirm a potential
                        detection from something like LSST. Currently, every night a list of potential <span class="jargon">NEOs</span> are posted to the <span class="jargon">NEOCP</span>, the
                        Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page for the follow-up network to observe. This list displays around two dozen objects per night at the moment...but that's all going to change
                        when <strike>the fire nation attacks</strike> LSST comes online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (<span class="jargon">LSST</span>) is going to rapidly identify solar system objects from its first night of observations.
                        Due to its ability to see fainter objects that current surveys, this will shed a new light on previously elusive solar system objects. Before this project we suspected this
                        could have dire implications for <span class="jargon">NEO</span> follow-up but now we have quantified this issue.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="sims">Simulating NEO follow-up during LSST</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hopefully you're now convinced it is a good idea to keep track of all of these objects! Our job at this point was to simulate how LSST will affect NEO follow-up and for that we
                        essentially need three things:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" />
                            A simulated population of solar system objects
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" />
                            A predicted schedule of where LSST will observe on each night for its 10 years
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" />
                            A method for scoring each potential object to decided whether it warrants follow-up
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The first step is relatively simple since catalogues of these objects already exist, in particular we use the Simulated Solar System Catalogue (S3M). We did additionally
                        improve on this catalogue by accounting for prior known objects and created a hybrid catalogue, but I'll talk about that in a separate post.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the predicted schedule and observations we know the baseline survey strategy plan for LSST, which outlines which areas of the sky it will observe and for how long. We used
                        a simulator that follows this strategy but also includes predictions for the fraction of downtime and bad weather that could affect things as well. All in all these simulated
                        observations of the solar system span over 10 years and 50 million observations!

                        Finally, to talk about scoring potential NEOs we first need to briefly talk about observations and tracklets. Observations of solar system objects are general formed out of a
                        series of "tracklets", which consist of at least 2 observations within a short period of time. The motion over these short periods of time is generally linear and it is easier
                        to associate the two observations with one another. You can then connect these tracklets over time and fit an orbit to their motion (this is referred to as "linking"). Check
                        out the digram to see an example of this where we get 3 successive nights of observations.

                        In reality, there are uncertainties on observations and so multiple orbits can fit the same tracklet. The scoring of these tracklets are potential NEOs is simply done as a
                        fraction of the orbits that correspond to an NEO orbit (which remember from above just means a closest approach to the sun of 1.3 au). This calculation is done using a code
                        called <code>digest2</code>.

                    <p>
                        Okay so now putting that all together, we have a series of mock observations of simulated solar system objects, each of which is assigned an NEO score from 0 to 100. The
                        current threshold for submission to the NEOCP is a score of 65 and so, using thism we calculated, the number of objects that would be submitted to the NEOCP in the first year
                        of LSST using current criteria.

                    <p>
                        There's a lot of information in this plot so let's walk through it in detail. The top panel shows the traffic of the NEOCP, which means the total number of objects that will be
                        submitted to the NEOCP according to current criteria. The bottom panel shows the purity, which means the fraction of the submitted objects that are <i>actually</i> NEOs. Each
                        of these quantities are plotted over the first year of LSST and for a variety of required number of observations. For example, this means that the $N_{\rm obs} = 3$ line means
                        we only include that tracklets that have at least 3 observations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the top panel we see that the traffic could increase to as much as 50,000 objects in a single night and the purity could go as low as 0.5%. Remember that the current
                        numbers are around two dozen objects with a purity of around 25%. The impact of LSST is HUGE, even when requiring a large number of observations of each tracklet ðŸ˜¨
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In case you're wondering about the general trends: the long period increase and decrease is seasonal and is due to the ecliptic plane (where MBAs reside) moving low and being
                        observed more at certain times of year. The shorter term changes are due to the moon, you'll note there are dips in purity around every 30 days!
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="best_case">What about the best case scenario?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Well, that's not good for NEO follow-up! ðŸ˜± Let's imagine the best case scenario in which we can fully predict the future, would things be better? LSST can confirm many NEOs
                        without any help from the follow-up community, so if we knew beforehand which objects would get re-observed enough by LSST then we could skip sending them to the NEOCP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this scenario, the traffic can still get as high as 200 objects on a single night but for the majority of the year it should still be in the current range that the NEOCP
                        expects. The average purity is around 25% which is approximately what you find on the NEOCP currently. So this is great news!
                    </p>
                    <p>Now the simple question is: <b>how can we achieve or approximate this best case scenario without consulting an oracle?</b> Time to think about some mitigation strategies!</p>

                    <h2 id="mitigation">Predicting the future to mitigate LSST's impact on NEO follow-up</h2>
                    <p>
                        We've just said that if we could predict whether LSST will perform self-follow-up on objects then we'd be able to mitigate LSST's impact. This drove us to create an algorithm
                        that attempts to do exactly that!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For an object to be constrained by LSST it requires at least 2 observations per night, on 3 nights, in a 15 night window. (So we our miraculous foresight only needs to reach
                        about two weeks into the future ðŸ˜‰). Given these requirements, we need to answer two questions
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" />
                            Where will LSST point over the next two weeks?
                        </li>
                        <li class="list-group-item">
                            <input class="form-check-input me-1" type="checkbox" />
                            What is the location and brightness of the object during each exposure?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For predicting LSST's future pointings we use the <code>rubin_sim</code> python package to get an optimistic future schedule (optimistic because it doesn't account for
                        unscheduled downtime due to things like bad weather). In reality one may able to adapt this algorithm to account for the fact that we'll have some short term weather forecast
                        and increase its accuracy but we decided to make a conservative estimate.

                    <p>
                        Predicting the location and brightness of the object over time requires a well constrained orbit. The problem is that, from our observations, we only constrain the on-sky
                        position and motion, but we don't know the distance to the object or the speed at which it is moving towards or away from us. Therefore, there are many possible orbits that
                        could fit a given observation. Check out the plot to the right that I made to illustrate this point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can see that given a single set of observations from Earth (in the direction of the arrow), you can get a very different orbit. To account for this we create a grid of
                        potential orbits based on the distance and speed it is moving towards or away from us (restricted to ranges that are reasonable for an NEO).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For each of those orbits we compute its position and brightness over the course of the next two weeks using <code>OpenOrb</code>. From this point it is a simple matter of
                        checking for each orbit whether it is observed at least twice on 3 nights in this window. We assign the probability of self-follow-up as a simple fraction of these orbits that
                        achieve self-follow-up.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="future_results">How effective are we at predicting the future?</h3>
                    <p>
                        So how did we do? We find that we are able to accurately predict whether an object requires external follow-up 74% of the time on average! In other words, we are able to
                        predict the future for around 3 of every 4 objects. This has important implications for what LSST will send to the NEOCP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using a threshold of $p = 0.7$ for submitting an object to the NEOCP, we find that our algorithm reduces the average nightly traffic of the NEOCP back to around 200 objects per
                        night, very close to the best case scenario! However, only around 5% of these objects turn out to be actual NEOs. Let's talk more about why this is the case and what we can do
                        about it in the last section.

                                                    Our LSST self-follow-up prediction algorithm would reduce the traffic back to reasonable levels of approximately 200 objects per night. However the
                                                    purity still remains at an average of 5% due to the large MBA background

                                                    Due to the vast number of MBA observations in the first year, NEO follow-up will be difficult. For the first year an ecliptic latitude cut can be
                                                    used to remove MBAs from the sample. After the first year around 85% of MBAs will have been identified, whilst the rate of NEO observations will
                                                    remain roughly constant and so the purity of NEOCP submissions from LSST would return to reasonable levels when applying our algorithm
