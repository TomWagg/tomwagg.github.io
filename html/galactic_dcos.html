                <h2 id="why_gw">Why investigate gravitational waves?</h2>
                <p>
                    So before we get into the paper, let's take a step back and consider why it is interesting to
                    investigate gravitational waves. We've already got a bunch of telescopes that can observe pretty
                    much anything in the <span class="jargon">electromagnetic spectrum</span>, so why bother? Well, what
                    if what you're observing is behind a giant dust cloud, or doesn't emit any light? In this case,
                    gravitational waves could shed some light (pun intended) on a problem that would otherwise have been
                    unobservable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our purposes, gravitational waves are emitted when two objects spiral around one another. This
                    could be as simple as two dancers performing or two ice skaters holding hands and spinning around
                    one another. Or, it could be as dramatic as two black holes spinning around one another, closer and
                    closer until they merge. The difference is that the waves from those two black holes are
                    <i>significantly</i> stronger (and so, easier to detect) than those that you're emitted with your
                    friend on the ice rink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also important to highlight that the emission of gravitational waves is what causes two
                    objects (like two black holes) to merge. The gravitational waves carry away energy from the system
                    and so the two objects have to get closer to one another to compensate. This process accelerates
                    over time until the dramatic gravitational wave merger occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gravitational waves can give us access to regimes that were previously unobservable. Black holes
                    themselves will emit no light without an <span class="jargon">accretion disc</span>, and even then
                    it is difficult to learn more about the objects. However, gravitational waves can be used to observe
                    black holes directly in <span class="jargon">binary systems</span>. The extreme gravity around black
                    holes and neutron stars can be used to test the accuracy of <span class="jargon">general
                        relativity</span> as well as provide measurements on the <span class="jargon">Hubble
                        constant</span>, which measures the rate of expansion of the Universe. On top of all of this,
                    black holes and neutron stars are the endpoints of massive stars and so we can use them to learn
                    more about how these types of stars evolve.
                </p>
                <h2 id="why_lisa">Why use LISA to study double compact objects?</h2>
                <img src="../img/lisa.jpg" class="img-fluid-limited rounded m-md-2 float-md-end">
                <p>
                    So hopefully you now see why gravitational waves are interesting to study, let's talk more about why
                    LISA is useful. LISA is a space-based gravitational wave detector that will consist of three
                    satellites that will orbit the sun (following the path of the Earth). The image shows an artist's
                    impression of what it will look like. As you may be aware, we already have several operational
                    gravitational wave detectors. <a href="https://www.ligo.org/" target="_blank">LIGO, Virgo and
                        Kagra</a> have already detected several gravitational wave mergers, so you may ask, why do we
                    need LISA?
                </p>
                <p>
                    LISA will observe gravitational waves at a lower frequency than ground-based detectors. This means
                    that you can observe a local (within the Milky Way) <span class="jargon">stellar-mass</span> binary
                    long before the emission of gravitational waves causes it to merge. These sorts of detections have a
                    lot of potential for discovery, we could learn more about a whole array of phenomena, including
                    <span class="jargon">r-process enrichment</span>, <span class="jargon">kilonovae</span>, <span
                        class="jargon">short gamma-ray bursts</span> and <span class="jargon">neutrinos</span>. LISA
                    could be used to constrain the existence the so called <span class="jargon">"lower mass gap"</span>
                    in the <span class="jargon">black hole mass function</span>. Currently, we haven't detected any
                    black holes with masses between 2 and 5 times the mass of the sun and scientists wonder if this gap
                    is just from observational or is the result of some sort of formation process. Additionally, LISA
                    could link gravitational wave detections to <span class="jargon">pulsars</span> found with the <span
                        class="jargon">Square Kilometre Array</span> and this could be used to refine the measurements
                    in both detectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hopefully you're now as excited as me about the potential of gravitational wave detections with LISA
                    and now we can talk about my paper and the sorts of detections that I predict LISA will have!
                </p>
                <h2 id="methods">How did we produce our results?</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to learn about the LISA detectable population of binary black holes (<span
                        class="jargon">BHBHs</span>), black hole neutron stars (<span class="jargon">BHNSs</span>) and
                    binary neutron stars (<span class="jargon">NSNSs</span>), we ran several detailed computer. We took
                    a large population of binaries, positioned them such that they resemble the Milky Way and then
                    evolved them until present day. We then repeated this all many times to work out how uncertain our
                    results were.
                </p>
                <div class="subsec">
                    <h4 id="pop_synth">First, we need some binaries</h4>
                    <p>
                        So first, the binaries. We use simulations from Floor Broekgaarden's <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02608" target="_blank">recent (and upcoming) papers</a>.
                        Floor used the population synthesis code <a href="https://www.compas.science/"
                            target="_blank">COMPAS</a> to produce a <i>huge</i> grid of over 2 billion massive binaries.
                        This code essentially follows a series of rules that state how the luminosity and temperature of
                        a star changes over time and also what sort of <span class="jargon">compact object</span> the
                        star becomes upon its death. These rules are based on very detailed stellar models, which
                        computed the evolution of certain stars based on the equations of stellar structure. You can
                        read more about how COMPAS works <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10352">in our methods
                            paper</a> and also more about how the original models were computed in Hurley et al. (<a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001295">2000</a>, <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0201220">2002</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Floor's simulations also cover 20 different binary physics variations. This means that each
                        simulation changes a setting in the COMPAS code to explore how the results change if we assume
                        something different about binary physics. This is important because a lot of binary physics is
                        still unknown and so by exploring these changes we can see how important each uncertainty is for
                        LISA detections.

                        Time to build a galaxy! For this part of the paper, Neige Frankel's expertise was essential. She
                        helped us to design a new model for the Milky Way. This model was created based on data from the
                        APOGEE surveys. The model contains three different components: a central bulge/bar component in
                        the centre of the galaxy, a thick disc, which contains older stars and is more vertically spread
                        out, and a thin disc, which contains younger stars and is less vertically spread out. The
                        distribution in terms of positions and birth times in each component is different and is shown
                        in the figure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than its more complex models for the birth times and positions, the main of this model is
                        that it is <i>metallicity dependent</i>. This means that the position and birth time of a system
                        corresponds to its <span class="jargon">metallicity</span>. Previous studies just assumed the
                        same metallicity for every system and this can produce misleading results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The figure shows show the different galactic parameters are distributed. For example, the purple
                        plot shows that most systems are formed earlier in the galaxy, whilst fewer are formed in the
                        past 2 billion years or so. The right hand side shows an example Milky Way created using this
                        model with both a face-on and side-on view.

                        Last, we need to evolve the sources until present day and work out whether LISA could detect

                            target="_blank"><code>LEGWORK</code></a>, a Python package that I developed with Katie
                        Breivik with this exact purpose in mind! We use the package to evolve the sources over time and
                        then calculate their signal-to-noise ratios in LISA. For any sources that have a signal which is
                        7 or more times stronger than the noise, we mark it as detectable. For more information about <a

                <p>
                    Great! So now we follow the methods above to produce <i>many</i> different Milky Way instances and
                    find detectable populations in each one. We repeat this for every different physics variation and
                    also each double compact object (DCO) type (<span class="jargon">BHBHs</span>, <span
                        class="jargon">BHNSs</span> and <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span>). The result of all of this is
                    collection of detectable sources that we can analyse to see what sort of things LISA will see.
                    For a 4-year LISA mission, our fiducial model predicts that, on average, LISA will detect 74 BHBHs,
                    42 BHNSs and 8 NSNSs. And that's an important enough results for me to repeat it in a blockquote for

                        A common way of visualising a detectable population in LISA is to plot the sources on the LISA
                        "sensitivity curve". The sensitivity curve shows how well LISA can measure signals at different
                        frequencies. The higher the sensitivity curve at any frequency, the more difficult it is to
                        detect a source at that frequency. For binaries, the frequency shows how quickly the two objects
                        are orbiting one another. The higher the frequency, the faster the objects are orbiting. This
                        means that sources on the left side of the plot are spinning slowly, whilst those on the right
                        side are spinning quickly and getting close to merging.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's just focus on the top panel for now, which contains all three types of <span
                            class="jargon">DCO</span> together. Each source is plotted at the frequency where it emits
                        most of its gravitational waves and its height above the sensitivity curve tells you its
                        signal-to-noise ratio. Since there are so many sources we don't plot them individually but show
                        a density distribution instead. The blue area shows the density distribution, where the darker
                        the density distribution is the more systems are found in that location. The first thing we
                        notice is that there is a gap between the sensitivity curve and the distribution, this is
                        because we only show detectable sources and they have to be 7 times higher than the curve by
                        definition! You can also see that the darkest part of the distribution (i.e. where most sources
                        are detected) coincides with the line for 8kpc, which is roughly the distance to the centre of
                        the galaxy. This makes sense since most sources are formed at the Galactic centre so it also
                        follows that are most are detected there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now let's look at the lower panels. It is slightly difficult to see but, if you look closely,
                        <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span> are detected at lower frequencies than <span
                            class="jargon">BHNSs</span> and the same is true for <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span>
                        relative to <span class="jargon">NSNSs</span>. You'll also see this more in the next section.
                        Finally, in each of the panels you can see there is a sort of "offshoot" that extends lower than
                        the rest of the distribution. We show in the paper that this is from <span
                            class="jargon">eccentric systems</span> and so you can possible identify them from their
                        location in the sensitivity curve.

                        Now let's take a look at some of the different parameters of the detectable systems. The plot
                        shows the distribution of 6 particular parameters for the <span class="jargon">fiducial</span>
                        model. Note that explaining the distributions that we see can be require quite a lot of
                        background knowledge so I'm only going to describe what we see in this section and if you want
                        to read more about <i>why</i> the distributions looks this way then check out Section 3.2 in the
                        paper. Also note, that you can click on the plot to zoom in!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In each panel, there are three curves which show the distribution for a different <span
                            class="jargon">DCO</span> type. <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span> are purple, <span
                            class="jargon">BHNSs</span> are pink and <span class="jargon">NSNSs</span> are yellow. In
                        the first panel (a), we see that the <span class="jargon">orbital frequency</span> is generally
                        most likely to be on the order of half a millihertz. Importantly, we note that <span
                            class="jargon">BHBHs</span> are detected at lower frequencies than <span
                            class="jargon">BHNSs</span>, which are in turn detected at lower frequencies than <span
                            class="jargon">NSNSs</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the second panel (b), we show the distribution of the black hole mass (and hence <span
                            class="jargon">NSNSs</span> are not in this panel). A key point from this plot is that there
                        is a large fraction of systems detected in the <span class="jargon">"lower mass gap"</span> and
                        we'll discuss the importance of this later on. Another thing to notice is that the <span
                            class="jargon">BHNS</span> and <span class="jargon">BHBH</span> curves has two peaks. The
                        <span class="jargon">BHBH</span> peaks come from the primary and secondary
                        black holes generally having unequal masses, whilst the <span class="jargon">BHNS</span> peaks
                        come from having a mass ratio distribution with two peaks. This leads us nicely into the mass
                        ratio panel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <span class="jargon">mass ratio</span> panel (c), shows that the different <span
                            class="jargon">DCO</span> types have
                        very different mass ratio distributions. The mass ratio tells you how the masses of two <span
                            class="jargon">compact objects</span> in a binary compare. A mass ratio of 1 means that
                        their masses are equal and the lower the mass ratio, the more unequal the mass are. <span
                            class="jargon">NSNSs</span> have mass ratios very close to 1 usually and so we see that they
                        are usually equal mass in our simulations. In constrast, <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span> and
                        especially <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span> generally have lower mass ratios and so the two
                        objects don't usually have equal masses. This is expected for <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span>
                        since black holes and neutron stars have very different masse, but this is surprising for <span
                            class="jargon">BHBHs</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fourth panel show the <span class="jargon">eccentricity</span> distribution. Importantly, we
                        find that all detectable DCOs have nonzero (and sometimes, significant) eccentricity, which can
                        be useful for distinguishing
                        them from
                        other LISA sources which are often circular. <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span> are the most
                        circular (closest to $e = 0.0$) of the <span class="jargon">DCO</span> types. <span
                            class="jargon">NSNSs</span> have the most "mildly
                        eccentric" ($0.01 < e < 0.3$) population, whilst <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span> have the
                            largest highly eccentric population.

                            We find that all detectable DCOs have nonzero (and sometimes, significant) eccentricity,
                            which can be useful for distinguishing them from other LISA sources which are often circular

                    <p>
                        We show how long it has been since each <span class="jargon">DCO</span> formed in the fifth
                        panel (e). The grey dotted line shows the distribution of when systems were formed (no matter
                        whether they are detectable). So we see a stark contrast between the main population (which is
                        mostly formed at early times) and the detectable populations (which are mainly formed at
                        relatively recent times). In the last panel (f), we show how long it would take each system to
                        merge after being detected in LISA and you can see that each <span class="jargon">DCO</span>
                        type shows approximately the same distribution and that most systems will take roughly a million
                        years to merge.

                        So we've talked about what the sources are like, and where they lie in relation to the
                        sensitivity curve, but what about something more intuitive like where they are in the Milky Way?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The plot shows how the detectable systems are distributed in the Milky Way with a face-on view.
                        First some quick notes on how the plot is set up: the axes are centred on the Galactic centre,
                        (0, 0) kpc, and I've added some black lines to guide your eye. You can also see a small circle
                        with a dot in it, this represents the location of the solar system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The blue density distribution (and points) show where all detectable <span
                            class="jargon">DCO</span> types are found. As expected the peak is in the Galactic centre,
                        since that is where most systems are formed. There is also a slight bias where the peak is not
                        <i>quite</i> in the centre and is actually slightly closer to the solar system. This is because
                        systems that are closer to LISA are easier to detect and so we are more likely to detect them
                        closer to us. The coloured lines show where 90% of each individual <span
                            class="jargon">DCO</span> type is found, where <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span> and <span
                            class="jargon">BHNSs</span> are fairly similar, though <span class="jargon">NSNSs</span> can
                        be detected a slightly larger distances.

                    <h4 id="measurements">How well can we measure these sources?</h4>
                    <p>
                        An important question to ask is how well can we measure these sources. It's all well and good
                        that we can predict from simulations what the properties of the detectable systems, but we also
                        need to know what LISA will actually measure. In a series of plots below, I've shown you the
                        distribution of signal-to-noise ratios, the error on the chirp mass and the angular resolution
                        as cumulative distributions that are scaled to the expected number of detections in our <span
                            class="jargon">fiducial</span> model. This means that the y-value at any given x-value tells
                        you how many detections have that x-value or less.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The signal-to-noise ratio plot shows that many systems are detected with an <span
                            class="jargon">SNR</span> less than or equal to 10 and won't be very well measured. However,
                        we also see that there <i>are</i> sources with very high <span class="jargon">SNRs</span> (up to
                        hundreds!). The second plot shows how well could measure the <span class="jargon">chirp
                            mass</span>, which is a quantity that combines the two masses of a binary in a certain way.
                        The way to read this plot is that only systems out of the dark shaded regions have <span
                            class="jargon">chirp masses</span> that can be measured at all and only systems outside of
                        the shaded regions can be well measured (with at most 10% errors). Finally, the last plot shows
                        how well we can resolve a source on the sky (i.e. work out what direction it came from). To give
                        you a useful comparison, the angular size of the moon on the sky is about half a degree. So you
                        can see that in a 10 year mission, about 25 sources can be localised to a region that is no
                        bigger than the size of the moon in the night sky.

                <p>
                    So far, we have only shown results for our fiducial model, but we should also examine how altering
                    our assumptions about binary physics could change our results. We find that, over our 20 physics
                    variations, the expected number of detections in a 4-year LISA mission varies between approximately
                    30 and 370. This increases to between 50 and 550 for a 10-year mission. The variations that we
                    consider probe some of the more uncertain areas of binary physics and we aim to investigate out the
                    relative importance of each assumption.

                        The first thing that we can investigate when changing the underlying physics assumptions is
                        simply <i>how many</i> DCOs will we detect and this is exactly what the plot shows. The three
                        panels correspond to <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span>, <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span> and
                        <span class="jargon">NSNSs</span> respectively. Each point corresponds to a model on the x-axis
                        (from A to T), which are also labelled on the top of the plot in slightly more detail. The
                        y-axis gives the detection rate in a 4-year mission on the left and a 10-year mission on the
                        right. Note as well as the y-axis is a logarithmic scale not linear!

                    <p>
                        We split these variations into four main categories (show in the coloured banners): <span
                            class="fw-bold" style="color: #db2b25">mass transfer</span> (variations relating to how the
                        two stars
                        transfer mass between one another), <span class="fw-bold"
                            style="color: #FFE300">common-envelope</span> (variations relating to how <span

                        are initiated and ejected), <span class="fw-bold" style="color: #089CA3">supernovae</span>
                        (variations related to the <span class="jargon">compact objects</span> left behind after
                        supernovae and the kicks that they
                        receive) and finally <span class="fw-bold" style="color: #7030A0">stellar winds</span>
                        (variations in the strength of <span class="jargon">Wolf-Rayet</span>-like winds).

                    <p>
                        In the paper we describe in detail how each variation affects the detection rate and suggest
                        explanations for these trends. This is another part that would require a lot of background
                        knowledge and detail to explain so I recommend that you check out Section 4.1 if you'd like to
                        learn about why these trends appear!

                        However, we can still remark on the general trends. First, we can see that changing our choices
                        for the maximum neutron star mass (models M and N), not implementing <span
                            class="jargon">pair-instability supernovae</span> (model O), changing our <span
                            class="jargon">remnant mass prescription</span> (model L), or decreasing the efficiency of
                        <span class="jargon">Wolf-Rayet</span>-like winds each have very little effect on the
                        detection rate for each <span class="jargon">DCO</span> type. However, the rest of the models
                        can effect changes of at least a factor of two in the detection rate. These large changes
                        therefore highlight the fact that it is important to consider these model variations since
                        different choices in regards to binary physics assumptions can strongly affect the predicted
                        detection rates for LISA.

                        Although it is interesting to see how the number of detections is affected by assumptions we
                        make about binary physics, it would be a mistake to summarise these changes with a single
                        number. It is also important to examine how the <i>properties</i> of detectable systems change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, it would be impossible (or, at least, not very pleasant for you to read) to show how
                        every parameter of the system changes for every model variation. In the paper we focus on three
                        in particular and I will highlight one of them here (check out Section 4.2 of the paper to see
                        the others!).

                        An interesting point to consider is whether LISA could be used to put constraints on the
                        existence of the <span class="jargon">"lower mass gap"</span>. In the plot we show two curves
                        that show the distribution of the masses of each component in all detectable sources (weighted
                        by their detections rate, i.e. BHBHs are more important than NSNSs for the curve). Each curve
                        uses a different <span class="jargon">remnant mass prescription</span>, which is essentially a
                        set of rules that define what sort of <span class="jargon">compact object</span> a star becomes
                        when it dies. The grey line uses a prescription that allows systems to be formed at any mass,
                        whilst the blue line uses a prescription that forbids the formation of systems in the <span
                            class="jargon">"lower mass gap"</span> (from 2.5 to 5 solar masses).

                            Over our binary physics variations, approximately 30-70% of LISA detections (or, in terms of
                            detections, 15 to 156) will have at least one component in the lower mass gap

                    <p>
                        We see that if systems are formed with component masses in the gap, LISA will be able to detect
                        them. For our fiducial model, 55% of systems that LISA will detect will have at least one
                        component in the <span class="jargon">"lower mass gap"</span>. This fraction varies and we find
                        over our binary physics variations, approximately 30-70% of LISA detections (or, in terms of
                        detections, 15 to 156) will have at least one component in the lower mass gap. Overall, though
                        the fraction in the gap varies, if DCOs are formed in the gap, LISA will detect them. The
                        difficult comes in whether LISA will be able to measure the masses well enough to actually say
                        that they are in the gap. It is therefore difficult to say whether LISA could potentially put
                        constraints on the existence of a lower mass gap.

                            (about 1.2 solar masses). This means that if we can say with confidence that the total mass

                        Well, this is where it gets difficult. For discriminating between <span

                        The maximum neutron star mass is around 2.5 solar masses and we can split the population to
                        systems that don't contain any black holes and those that must contain at least one. For a

                        Finally, for telling the difference between <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span> and <span

                <p>
                    In Section 6 of the paper, we compare our results to similar studies that were conducted in the
                    past. I recommend you read that section if you'd like to see what where we think the reasons for our
                    differences come from. Below I include the table of comparisons that collated and you can examine
                    the difference between the studies. For reference, in the later columns the darker the shade of
                    green, the more reasonable/accurate we find the assumption.
