                <h2 id="why_gw">Why investigate gravitational waves?</h2>
                <p>
                    So before we get into the paper, let's take a step back and consider why it is interesting to
                    investigate gravitational waves. We've already got a bunch of telescopes that can observe pretty
                    much anything in the <span class="jargon">electromagnetic spectrum</span>, so why bother? Well, what
                    if what you're observing is behind a giant dust cloud, or doesn't emit any light? In this case,
                    gravitational waves could shed some light (pun intended) on a problem that would otherwise have been
                    unobservable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our purposes, gravitational waves are emitted when two objects spiral around one another. This
                    could be as simple as two dancers performing or two ice skaters holding hands and spinning around
                    one another. Or, it could be as dramatic as two black holes spinning around one another, closer and
                    closer until they merge. The difference is that the waves from those two black holes are
                    <i>significantly</i> stronger (and so, easier to detect) than those that you're emitted with your
                    friend on the ice rink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also important to highlight that the emission of gravitational waves is what causes two
                    objects (like two black holes) to merge. The gravitational waves carry away energy from the system
                    and so the two objects have to get closer to one another to compensate. This process accelerates
                    over time until the dramatic gravitational wave merger occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gravitational waves can give us access to regimes that were previously unobservable. Black holes
                    themselves will emit no light without an <span class="jargon">accretion disc</span>, and even then
                    it is difficult to learn more about the objects. However, gravitational waves can be used to observe
                    black holes directly in <span class="jargon">binary systems</span>. The extreme gravity around black
                    holes and neutron stars can be used to test the accuracy of <span class="jargon">general
                        relativity</span> as well as provide measurements on the <span class="jargon">Hubble
                        constant</span>, which measures the rate of expansion of the Universe. On top of all of this,
                    black holes and neutron stars are the endpoints of massive stars and so we can use them to learn
                    more about how these types of stars evolve.
                </p>
                <h2 id="why_lisa">Why use LISA to study double compact objects?</h2>
                <img src="../img/lisa.jpg" class="img-fluid-limited rounded m-md-2 float-md-end">
                <p>
                    So hopefully you now see why gravitational waves are interesting to study, let's talk more about why
                    LISA is useful. LISA is a space-based gravitational wave detector that will consist of three
                    satellites that will orbit the sun (following the path of the Earth). The image shows an artist's
                    impression of what it will look like. As you may be aware, we already have several operational
                    gravitational wave detectors. <a href="https://www.ligo.org/" target="_blank">LIGO, Virgo and
                        Kagra</a> have already detected several gravitational wave mergers, so you may ask, why do we
                    need LISA?
                </p>
                <p>
                    LISA will observe gravitational waves at a lower frequency than ground-based detectors. This means
                    that you can observe a local (within the Milky Way) <span class="jargon">stellar-mass</span> binary
                    long before the emission of gravitational waves causes it to merge. These sorts of detections have a
                    lot of potential for discovery, we could learn more about a whole array of phenomena, including
                    <span class="jargon">r-process enrichment</span>, <span class="jargon">kilonovae</span>, <span
                        class="jargon">short gamma-ray bursts</span> and <span class="jargon">neutrinos</span>. LISA
                    could be used to constrain the existence the so called <span class="jargon">"lower mass gap"</span>
                    in the <span class="jargon">black hole mass function</span>. Currently, we haven't detected any
                    black holes with masses between 2 and 5 times the mass of the sun and scientists wonder if this gap
                    is just from observational or is the result of some sort of formation process. Additionally, LISA
                    could link gravitational wave detections to <span class="jargon">pulsars</span> found with the <span
                        class="jargon">Square Kilometre Array</span> and this could be used to refine the measurements
                    in both detectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hopefully you're now as excited as me about the potential of gravitational wave detections with LISA
                    and now we can talk about my paper and the sorts of detections that I predict LISA will have!
                </p>
                <h2 id="methods">How did we produce our results?</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to learn about the LISA detectable population of binary black holes (<span
                        class="jargon">BHBHs</span>), black hole neutron stars (<span class="jargon">BHNSs</span>) and
                    binary neutron stars (<span class="jargon">NSNSs</span>), we ran several detailed computer. We took
                    a large population of binaries, positioned them such that they resemble the Milky Way and then
                    evolved them until present day. We then repeated this all many times to work out how uncertain our
                    results were.
                </p>
                <div class="subsec">
                    <h4 id="pop_synth">First, we need some binaries</h4>
                    <p>
                        So first, the binaries. We use simulations from Floor Broekgaarden's <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02608" target="_blank">recent (and upcoming) papers</a>.
                        Floor used the population synthesis code <a href="https://www.compas.science/"
                            target="_blank">COMPAS</a> to produce a <i>huge</i> grid of over 2 billion massive binaries.
                        This code essentially follows a series of rules that state how the luminosity and temperature of
                        a star changes over time and also what sort of <span class="jargon">compact object</span> the
                        star becomes upon its death. These rules are based on very detailed stellar models, which
                        computed the evolution of certain stars based on the equations of stellar structure. You can
                        read more about how COMPAS works <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10352">in our methods
                            paper</a> and also more about how the original models were computed in Hurley et al. (<a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001295">2000</a>, <a
                            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0201220">2002</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Floor's simulations also cover 20 different binary physics variations. This means that each
                        simulation changes a setting in the COMPAS code to explore how the results change if we assume
                        something different about binary physics. This is important because a lot of binary physics is
                        still unknown and so by exploring these changes we can see how important each uncertainty is for
                        LISA detections.

                        Time to build a galaxy! For this part of the paper, Neige Frankel's expertise was essential. She
                        helped us to design a new model for the Milky Way. This model was created based on data from the
                        APOGEE surveys. The model contains three different components: a central bulge/bar component in
                        the centre of the galaxy, a thick disc, which contains older stars and is more vertically spread
                        out, and a thin disc, which contains younger stars and is less vertically spread out. The
                        distribution in terms of positions and birth times in each component is different and is shown
                        in the figure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other than its more complex models for the birth times and positions, the main of this model is
                        that it is <i>metallicity dependent</i>. This means that the position and birth time of a system
                        corresponds to its <span class="jargon">metallicity</span>. Previous studies just assumed the
                        same metallicity for every system and this can produce misleading results.

                    <p>
                        The figure shows show the different galactic parameters are distributed. For example, the purple
                        plot shows that most systems are formed earlier in the galaxy, whilst fewer are formed in the
                        past 2 billion years or so. The right hand side shows an example Milky Way created using this
                        model with both a face-on and side-on view.

                        Last, we need to evolve the sources until present day and work out whether LISA could detect

                        Breivik with this exact purpose in mind! We use the package to evolve the sources over time and
                        then calculate their signal-to-noise ratios in LISA. For any sources that have a signal which is
                        7 or more times stronger than the noise, we mark it as detectable. For more information about <a

                <p>
                    Great! So now we follow the methods above to produce <i>many</i> different Milky Way instances and
                    find detectable populations in each one. We repeat this for every different physics variation and
                    also each double compact object (DCO) type (<span class="jargon">BHBHs</span>, <span
                        class="jargon">BHNSs</span> and <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span>). The result of all of this is
                    collection of detectable sources that we can analyse to see what sort of things LISA will see. Note
                    that for this section we're just going to consider the <span class="jargon">fiducial</span> model

                    <p>
                        A common way of visualising a detectable population in LISA is to plot the sources on the LISA
                        "sensitivity curve". The sensitivity curve shows how well LISA can measure signals at different
                        frequencies. The higher the sensitivity curve at any frequency, the more difficult it is to
                        detect a source at that frequency. For binaries, the frequency shows how quickly the two objects
                        are orbiting one another. The higher the frequency, the faster the objects are orbiting. This
                        means that sources on the left side of the plot are spinning slowly, whilst those on the right
                        side are spinning quickly and getting close to merging.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's just focus on the top panel for now, which contains all three types of <span
                            class="jargon">DCO</span> together. Each source is plotted at the frequency where it emits
                        most of its gravitational waves and its height above the sensitivity curve tells you its
                        signal-to-noise ratio. Since there are so many sources we don't plot them individually but show
                        a density distribution instead. The blue area shows the density distribution, where the darker
                        the density distribution is the more systems are found in that location. The first thing we
                        notice is that there is a gap between the sensitivity curve and the distribution, this is
                        because we only show detectable sources and they have to be 7 times higher than the curve by
                        definition! You can also see that the darkest part of the distribution (i.e. where most sources
                        are detected) coincides with the line for 8kpc, which is roughly the distance to the centre of
                        the galaxy. This makes sense since most sources are formed at the Galactic centre so it also
                        follows that are most are detected there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now let's look at the lower panels. It is slightly difficult to see but, if you look closely,
                        <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span> are detected at lower frequencies than <span
                            class="jargon">BHNSs</span> and the same is true for <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span>
                        relative to <span class="jargon">NSNSs</span>. You'll also see this more in the next section.
                        Finally, in each of the panels you can see there is a sort of "offshoot" that extends lower than
                        the rest of the distribution. We show in the paper that this is from <span
                            class="jargon">eccentric systems</span> and so you can possible identify them from their
                        location in the sensitivity curve.

                        Now let's take a look at some of the different parameters of the detectable systems. The plot
                        shows the distribution of 6 particular parameters for the <span class="jargon">fiducial</span>
                        model. Note that explaining the distributions that we see can be require quite a lot of
                        background knowledge so I'm only going to describe what we see in this section and if you want
                        to read more about <i>why</i> the distributions looks this way then check out Section 3.2 in the
                        paper. Also note, that you can click on the plot to zoom in!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In each panel, there are three curves which show the distribution for a different <span
                            class="jargon">DCO</span> type. <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span> are purple, <span
                            class="jargon">BHNSs</span> are pink and <span class="jargon">NSNSs</span> are yellow. In
                        the first panel (a), we see that the <span class="jargon">orbital frequency</span> is generally
                        most likely to be on the order of half a millihertz. Importantly, we note that <span
                            class="jargon">BHBHs</span> are detected at lower frequencies than <span
                            class="jargon">BHNSs</span>, which are in turn detected at lower frequencies than <span
                            class="jargon">NSNSs</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the second panel (b), we show the distribution of the black hole mass (and hence <span
                            class="jargon">NSNSs</span> are not in this panel). A key point from this plot is that there
                        is a large fraction of systems detected in the <span class="jargon">"lower mass gap"</span> and
                        we'll discuss the importance of this later on. Another thing to notice is that the <span
                            class="jargon">BHBH</span> curve has two peaks, which come from the primary and secondary
                        black holes generally have unequal masses. This leads us nicely into the mass ratio panel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <span class="jargon">mass ratio</span> panel (c), shows that the different <span
                            class="jargon">DCO</span> types have
                        very different mass ratio distributions. The mass ratio tells you how the masses of two <span
                            class="jargon">compact objects</span> in a binary compare. A mass ratio of 1 means that
                        their masses are equal and the lower the mass ratio, the more unequal the mass are. <span
                            class="jargon">NSNSs</span> have mass ratios very close to 1 usually and so we see that they
                        are usually equal mass in our simulations. In constrast, <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span> and
                        especially <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span> generally have lower mass ratios and so the two
                        objects don't usually have equal masses. This is expected for <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span>
                        since black holes and neutron stars have very different masse, but this is surprising for <span
                            class="jargon">BHBHs</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fourth panel show the <span class="jargon">eccentricity</span> distribution. Importantly, we
                        find that all of the DCOs are fairly eccentric, which can be useful for distinguishing them from
                        other LISA sources which are often circular. <span class="jargon">BHNSs</span> are the most
                        circular (closest to $e = 0.0$) of the <span class="jargon">DCO</span> types. <span
                            class="jargon">NSNSs</span> have the most "mildly
                        eccentric" ($0.01 < e < 0.3$) population, whilst <span class="jargon">BHBHs</span> have the
                            largest highly eccentric population.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We show how long it has been since each <span class="jargon">DCO</span> formed in the fifth
                        panel (e). The grey dotted line shows the distribution of when systems were formed (no matter
                        whether they are detectable). So we see a stark contrast between the main population (which is
                        mostly formed at early times) and the detectable populations (which are mainly formed at
                        relatively recent times). In the last panel (f), we show how long it would take each system to
                        merge after being detected in LISA and you can see that each <span class="jargon">DCO</span>
                        type shows approximately the same distribution and that most systems will take roughly a million
                        years to merge.
