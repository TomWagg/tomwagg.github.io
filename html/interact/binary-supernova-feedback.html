                    <h2>A brief overview</h2>
                    <p>Welcome! You've found the page for the interactive plots for our paper about how binary interactions can delay and displace core-collapse supernova feedback.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What did we do?</b> In this study, we used <code data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="A code I developed that combines COSMIC and Gala to evolve binaries and integrate their positions through galactic potentials in a self-consistent manner">cogsworth</code> to postprocess the <code data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="The FIRE (Feedback In Real Environment) team develop realistic hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation">FIRE</code> m11h hydrodynamical zoom-in
                        simulation and perform self-consistent population synthesis and galactic dynamics simulations. This allows us to evolve a large population of binaries through a galactic potential and track the precise times and locations are which the stars reached core collapse. We repeated these simulations for a range of different assumptions regarding binary physics, initial conditions and galaxy parameters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What are our main results?</b> We find that ~25% of supernovae occur more than <span class="explainer" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="The current limit assumed in FIRE-3 feedback models, based on single star evolution">44 Myr</span> after a star formation event. We also find that ~13% of supernovae explode more than 0.1kpc from their parent star clusters. These effects are both exacerbated in lower
                        <span class="explainer" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Metallicity describes the fraction of 'metals' (i.e. not hydrogen or helium) in a star or in gas. Lower metallicity stars expand less and require a lower core mass to reach supernova">metallicity</span> environments. We find that our results are mostly robust to uncertainties in binary physics and the other variations we considered, as you can explore below. We also created an analytic model for supernova feedback
                        that can used in future models.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Why does this matter?</b> Supernovae produce feedback in galaxies, which can inhibit further star formation. We find that feedback should extend over longer times and be spatially distributed to a greater extent than current feedback models. This may affect the evolution of galaxies, particularly those at high redshift since they are lower metallicity environments and much smaller.</p>
                    <p><b>How can I use this page?</b> We have made several of the plots from our paper interactive to allow you to explore the full range of models that we explored. Each section below will explain the plot and how you can interact with it - enjoy!</p>

                    <p>This section is an interactive version of the top right panel of Figure 1 from our paper. At first, this plot just shows the same fiducial population that you see in the paper (except you can zoom, pan and hover to get more information).</p>
                    <p>To start changing things, try switching between stacked and separate histograms to better understand how the different progenitor channels vary. You can also use the sliders and play/pause buttons to start imposing an upper limit on the timing of the supernovae. Finally, there's a list of all of the models that we ran that you can switch between to see how the distribution varies.</p>

                                    <b>More mass and angular momentum is lost from the system!</b> Fully nonconservative mass transfer means that all mass donated by a primary star is immediately lost from the system rather than accreted by the secondary. As a result, secondaries are often not as massive as the fiducial model and as such, don't expand and cause a reverse mass transfer event, which would lead to a merger. This reduced expansion of many secondaries reduces the number of merger
                                    products.
                                </p>
                                <p>The mass lost from the system also carries away angular momentum. The loss of angular momentum causes many binaries to tighten, increasing the orbital velocity of the system. Therefore, ejected secondaries are typically faster, thereby increasing the distance that they travel before reaching core collapse.</p>

                                <p><b>Stars need less mass to explode and expand less during their lives!</b> At lower metallicity, the minimum mass required for a star to reach core collapse in the underlying stellar models is reduced. This lower limit allows less massive (i.e., more slowly evolving) stars to reach core collapse. These lower mass stars extend the tail of late supernovae.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, the lower radial extent of low metallicity stars means that they can detach from Roche lobe overflow at much smaller separations. Therefore, binaries are often tighter at the moment of a primary star's core collapse, increasing the ejection velocities of secondaries.</p>
