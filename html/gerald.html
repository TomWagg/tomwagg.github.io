                    <a href="https://github.com/TomWagg/gerald">Gerald</a> is a Slack bot that I made for the UW Astrograds slack workspace. He hangs around trying to make your life easier/occasionally make
                    you laugh with his shenanigans. I designed him for fun but I hope he can actually be useful too ðŸ™ƒ
                </p>

            <div class="row mt-3">
                <h1 class="fw-bold">What can Gerald do?</h1>
                <p class="fs-5">Gerald's been working hard to expand his skillset and currently he'll interact with you in Slack in three main ways</p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold">Scheduled tasks</h3>
                <p class="fs-5">Every morning Gerald will tick a couple of items off his todo list</p>
                <div class="ms-4">
                    <p class="fs-5">
                        <code>any_new_publications</code> - First, Gerald will peruse the arXiv at a leisurely pace, disregarding every paper he sees unless he finds a UW astrograd in the author list.
                        When this happens he'll get all excited and announce the paper to everyone in the workspace!
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-5">
                        <code>is_it_a_birthday</code> - Then he'll check his calendar and see whether today is someone's birthday. If he realises that it is then he'll wish them happy birthday and
                        give the person a birthday GIF, how thoughtful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-5">
                        <code>whinetime_workflow</code> - Finally, if he notices it is Monday he'll first groan internally (because Mondays) and then pick the next grad in his randomly ordered list to host whinetime this week.
                        He'll send that person a message in the whinetime channel and let them select the day/time/location (or let them give up the job for this week). After the host has set up the
                        logistics Gerald will announce to everyone what the plan is and send automated reminders as the day gets closer.
                    </p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold">Actions & Responses after <code>@Gerald</code> mentions</h3>

                <p class="fs-5">
                    Gerald is always at your beck and call. Simply write <code>@Gerald</code> and then say something to him or give him a task and he'll get right to it. Additionally, you can send him
                    a direct message instead and then you can use all of these same commands without even needing to mention him. Here's a list of things you can ask him or get him to do
                </p>

                <p class="fs-5">
                    Gerald will also listen to any messages that are sent in channels that you invite him to and then respond or react to some of them. Here are a list of things that may elicit some sort of response or reaction from Gerald but there are more that aren't included here
                </p>

                <p class="example">
